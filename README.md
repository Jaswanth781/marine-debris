Marine debris, especially floating plastics, continues to 
threaten marine ecosystems and global environmental 
health. While traditional methods like drone-based aerial 
surveys or shoreline inspections provide localized 
monitoring, they lack scalability and cost-efficiency for 
ocean-wide surveillance. Prior machine learning 
approaches—such as those using XGBoost on Sentinel-2 
imagery—struggle to distinguish plastics from spectrally 
similar materials like seaweed, driftwood, and pumice. To 
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep 
learning framework based on TabNet, which leverages 
spectral indices and multispectral band features to classify 
marine debris into seven distinct categories while 
identifying each as natural or artificial.
